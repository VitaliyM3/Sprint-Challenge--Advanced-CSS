1. An adaptive website is usually used for a specific or a certain layout of a website, where the website is interactive and scales to 
different screen sizes at specific breakpoints for desktops, tablets, or mobile. It keeps the content fairly similar to keep a cetain feel to the website or 
a more specific UI design vs a responsive relies for on something like a grid layout and divs and content scaled by precentages so the page changes at any
size if needed to fit the screen.

2. Mobile first is when the developer starts out developing the website for mobile size screens/layout and then scaling up with breakpoints to larger sizes
such as tablet and then desktop. 

3. The default font size in html is 16px, adding the font-size: 62.5% adjusts the REM usit to be like this: 1rem is equal to 10px. so 1.6 rem would be 16px, this makes
it easier to do math on font sizes vs having to do multiply odd numbers to get a specific font size. It adds responsiveness to the website.

4.Preprocessing is when there is a compiler such as NODE that allows the use of new syntax such as LESS or SASS giving the web developer
 a more neat and easier way to layout their css with nesting. It also adds a few tools that make it easier to write CSS and keep
 the code DRY. It provides a way of using variables, mixins, and paramixins. It allows you to use some operations and functions in your
 CSS as well.

5. I like the nesting part, its a lot easier to target the CSS tags and read the CSS. I like how it makes media queries easy to use and keeps
me from having to write a lot of extra
